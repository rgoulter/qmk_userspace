This keymap tries to adapt the layouts I like, to fit with the 1x2U layout of the planck_mit.

"pinkie outer column" is an inconvientiently long name to refer to the natural
layout where the outermost columns of planck_mit are used for an additional outer column
for the pinky fingers. -- This is in contrast to 'splitting and shifting' the alphabetical characters,
so that the innermost central two columns are 'additional', and the hands rest with 4U between them instead of 2U.
