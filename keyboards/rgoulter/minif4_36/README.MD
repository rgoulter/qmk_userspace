## MiniF4-36: 36-key, split, reversible PCB with WeAct Studio Mini F4 dev board

Design goals:

- PCB smaller than 100x100 mm2, so that it's cheaper to fabricate at various PCB
  fabricators.
- Reversible PCB (use the same PCB for left/right halves).
- Using the WeAct Studio MiniF4 "black pill" dev board, a cheap STM32F4 dev
  board that runs ARM.
- Low profile (PCB + choc switches + bumpons).
- Column-staggered arrangement of key switches.
- Fancy features: e.g. per-key RGB LEDs, rotary encoders, OLED screen, DC vibration motors.
