## Pico42: Simple Hand-Solderable PCB in BM40/JJ40 Form-Factor

A very simple, hand-solderable PCB which uses the Raspberry Pi Pico dev board.

I made this design because in my first attempt at designing a CNC case for the PyKey40,
I put the cutout for the USB connector in the wrong place.
Having a design which doesn't use a USB connector underneath the PCB works around this.

The form factor encourages the thumbs to use 2-3 keys each (and rely on the pinky fingers less).

Design goals:

- Simple, hand-solderable PCB.

- Uses Raspberry Pi Pico devboard. / Doesn't use USB connector underneath PCB.

- Same mounting holes as JJ40/BM40/PyKey40.

- Same pinout as PyKey40 (PyKey60).
