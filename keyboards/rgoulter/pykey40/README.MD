## PyKey40 Lite: No-Frills Subset of the PyKey60 in BM40/JJ40 Form-Factor

My first PCBA design.

Takes jpconstantineau's [PyKey60](https://github.com/jpconstantineau/PyKey60),
and arranges a no-frills (no RGB, no hotswap, no speaker) subset of it to be a drop in replacement for the BM40/JJ40 PCB.

Design goals:

- As this is my first PCBA design: a simple design that works.

## PyKey40 HSRGB: 4x12 Ortholinear with HotSwap and RGB in BM40/JJ40 Form-Factor

A 4x12 ortholinear with hotswap sockets, and per-key RGB and underglow, using the RP2040 MCU, with mounts compatible with the JJ40/BM40.

Design goals:

- Fancy features: hotswap sockets, RGB.

- Same mounting holes as JJ40/BM40/PyKey40.
